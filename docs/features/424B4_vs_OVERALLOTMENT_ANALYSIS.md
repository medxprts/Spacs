# 424B4 vs Overallotment - Final Answer

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Question:** Does 424B4 have final share count after overallotment exercise?

---

## Short Answer

**❌ NO** - 424B4 typically shows **base offering** size, not post-overallotment.

**✅ Final numbers** come from:
1. **8-K** (if overallotment exercised immediately)
2. **10-Q** (definitive quarterly report)
3. **Subsequent 8-K** (if overallotment exercised later)

## What is Overallotment (Greenshoe)?

**Base Offering:** 36M units at $10 = $360M
**Overallotment Option:** 15% additional (5.4M units = $54M)

**Total IF Exercised:** 41.4M units = $414M

**Timeline:**
1. **424B4 filed** → IPO closes → Units start trading
2. **Within 30-45 days** → Underwriters decide on overallotment
3. **If exercised** → Additional shares issued, proceeds added

## CCCX Example Analysis

### Database Shows:
- Shares Outstanding: **41,400,000**
- IPO Proceeds: **$414M**
- IPO Date: May 15, 2025

### Calculation:
```
$414M / 41.4M shares = $10.00 per unit
41.4M = 36M base + 5.4M overallotment (15%)
```

**Conclusion:** CCCX numbers show **POST-overallotment** (fully exercised)

### Where Did These Numbers Come From?

**Options:**
1. **424B4 (May 15):** Would show 36M base OR "up to 41.4M if exercised"
2. **8-K (May 16):** Might say "offering closed, raised $414M" (ambiguous)
3. **10-Q (June 13):** Definitive - shows 41.4M shares outstanding ✅

### Validation:
From our SEC filing list, CCCX has:
- **May 15:** 424B4 filed
- **May 16:** 8-K filed (IPO closing)
- **June 13:** 10-Q filed ✅ (First quarterly report)

**Most Reliable:** The 10-Q (June 13) has the **definitive** share count.

---

## Industry Standard: When is Overallotment Decided?

**Typical Timeline:**
- **Day 0:** IPO closes (424B4 filed same day or day before)
- **Day 1-7:** Units trade, underwriters assess demand
- **Day 30-45:** Overallotment decision made
  - If stock trades well → Exercise (get more shares to sell)
  - If stock trades poorly → Don't exercise

**Filing Requirements:**
- **No specific filing** required for overallotment exercise
- Shows up in next **10-Q** as increased share count
- Sometimes announced via **8-K** if material

## What Does 424B4 Actually Contain?

### Confirmed Content:
✅ **Base offering size** (e.g., 36M units)
✅ **Overallotment option** (e.g., "up to 5.4M additional")
✅ **Unit structure** (1 common + 1/3 warrant)
✅ **Warrant terms** (exercise price, expiration)
✅ **Trust terms** (per-share NAV, redemption rights)
✅ **Underwriters** and fees
✅ **Use of proceeds**

❌ **NOT Finalized:** Whether overallotment was actually exercised

### Language Example (Typical 424B4):
```
"We are offering 36,000,000 units...

We have granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase
up to 5,400,000 additional units to cover over-allotments..."
```

**This is CONDITIONAL** - not a statement of final exercise.

## Implications for Your Platform

### Current Issue:
Your scraper currently pulls share count from filings, but timing matters:

**If you scrape 424B4 (Day 0):**
- Get base offering: 36M shares ❌ (missing 5.4M overallotment)

**If you scrape 8-K (Day 1):**
- Might say "closed offering of 36M units" ❌ (still pending overallotment)
- Or might be ambiguous

**If you scrape 10-Q (Day 45-90):**
- Definitive share count: 41.4M shares ✅ (includes overallotment if exercised)

### Recommendation:

**Tier 1: Quick Data (for detection)** - Use 424B4
- IPO date (exact)
- Base offering size (conservative estimate)
- Unit structure
- Trust terms
- **Mark shares as "preliminary"**

**Tier 2: Final Data (for accuracy)** - Use 10-Q
- Final share count after overallotment
- Actual trust cash
- Founder shares (from cap table)
- **Update shares to "finalized"**

---

## Solution: Multi-Stage Data Collection

### Stage 1: IPO Detection (424B4) - Days 0-1
```python
# Extract from 424B4
base_offering = 36_000_000  # Units
overallotment_option = 5_400_000  # 15% additional
max_offering = base_offering + overallotment_option  # 41.4M

# Save to database
spac.shares_outstanding = base_offering  # Conservative
spac.shares_outstanding_max = max_offering  # If fully exercised
spac.overallotment_status = 'PENDING'  # Not yet decided
```

### Stage 2: Overallotment Update (8-K or 10-Q) - Days 30-90
```python
# Check 10-Q for final numbers
if filing_type == '10-Q':
    final_shares = extract_share_count(filing)  # 41.4M

    if final_shares == base_offering:
        spac.overallotment_status = 'NOT_EXERCISED'
    elif final_shares == max_offering:
        spac.overallotment_status = 'FULLY_EXERCISED'
    else:
        spac.overallotment_status = 'PARTIALLY_EXERCISED'

    spac.shares_outstanding = final_shares  # Update to final
```

## Answer to Your Question

**Q: Does 424B4 have finalized total shares due to overallotment?**

**A: NO** - 424B4 typically filed BEFORE overallotment decision.

**Timeline:**
1. ✅ 424B4 has: Base offering + overallotment OPTION
2. ⏰ 30-45 days later: Overallotment decision made
3. ✅ 10-Q has: Final share count (definitive)

---

## Practical Impact

### For Early Detection (SME's Point):
**424B4 is still valuable** for:
- ✅ Detecting IPO closing (3 days earlier than 8-K)
- ✅ Getting 95% of key data (except final overallotment)
- ✅ Base share count (conservative estimate)

### For Final Accuracy:
**Need 10-Q** for:
- ✅ Definitive share count post-overallotment
- ✅ Actual trust cash
- ✅ Founder shares (cap table)

---

## Recommendation

### Phase 1: Use 424B4 for Detection ✅
```python
# Prioritize 424B4 as SME suggested
# Get 95% of data 3 days earlier
# Mark shares as "preliminary"
```

### Phase 2: Update from 10-Q (45-90 days later) ✅
```python
# When 10-Q filed, update:
# - Final share count
# - Overallotment status
# - Trust cash
# - Mark shares as "finalized"
```

**Best of Both Worlds:**
- Early detection from 424B4 ✅
- Final accuracy from 10-Q ✅

---

## Implementation

### Add to Database Schema:
```python
# Add columns to track overallotment
class SPAC(Base):
    # ... existing columns ...

    # Overallotment tracking
    shares_outstanding_preliminary = Column(Float)  # From 424B4
    shares_outstanding_max = Column(Float)  # If fully exercised
    overallotment_status = Column(String)  # PENDING/EXERCISED/NOT_EXERCISED
    overallotment_finalized_date = Column(Date)  # When 10-Q confirmed
```

### Update Scraper Logic:
```python
# 1. On 424B4 detection (Day 0)
extract_preliminary_shares(filing_424b4)

# 2. On 10-Q detection (Day 45-90)
finalize_shares_from_10q(filing_10q)
```

## Summary

| Metric | 424B4 (Day 0) | 10-Q (Day 60) | Winner |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **IPO Detection** | ✅ Immediate | ❌ 60 days late | 424B4 |
| **Final Share Count** | ⚠️ Preliminary | ✅ Definitive | 10-Q |
| **Overallotment Status** | ❌ Not decided | ✅ Confirmed | 10-Q |
| **Trust Cash** | ✅ Base amount | ✅ Final amount | Both |
| **Unit Structure** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | Both |

**Conclusion:**
- Use **424B4 for speed** (3 days earlier)
- Use **10-Q for accuracy** (final numbers)
- Implement **two-stage data collection**

**Does this answer your question?** The SME is correct about 424B4 coming first, but you're also correct that it doesn't have the **final** overallotment numbers. Solution: Use both!
