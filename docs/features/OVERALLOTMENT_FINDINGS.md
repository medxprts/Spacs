# Overallotment Data Sources - Final Answer

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Question:** Where do we get final share counts after overallotment exercise?

---

## Key Findings

### Filing Timeline:
1. **424B4** (May 15) - Final prospectus, filed BEFORE IPO closes
2. **Pricing 8-K** (May 13) - Price announcement (sometimes filed BEFORE 424B4)
3. **Closing 8-K** (May 16) - IPO closing announcement, 1-3 days AFTER 424B4
4. **10-Q** (45-90 days later) - Quarterly report with definitive numbers

### What Each Filing Contains:

| Filing | Timing | Base Offering | Overallotment Option | Final Shares | Accuracy |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Pricing 8-K** | Day -2 to 0 | ‚úÖ 36M | ‚úÖ "up to 5.4M" | ‚ùå Not decided | Preliminary |
| **424B4** | Day 0 | ‚úÖ 36M | ‚úÖ "up to 5.4M" | ‚ùå Not decided | Preliminary |
| **Closing 8-K** | Day +1 to +3 | ‚úÖ 36M | ‚úÖ Should show if exercised | ‚úÖ **LIKELY** | **Best source** |
| **10-Q** | Day +45 to +90 | ‚úÖ Final | ‚ùå Not mentioned | ‚úÖ Definitive | Confirmation |

## CCCX Example Analysis

### Test Results:

**Pricing 8-K (May 13, 2025):**
```
‚úÖ Found: 36,000,000 units (base offering)
‚úÖ Found: 5,400,000 units (overallotment OPTION)
‚ùå NOT FOUND: "exercised" or "full exercise" language
‚ùå NOT FOUND: 41,400,000 units (final)
```

**Conclusion:** Pricing announcement shows CONDITIONAL numbers only.

**Closing 8-K (May 16, 2025):**
- Our scraper currently picks up the PRICING 8-K (wrong one!)
- Need to find the actual CLOSING 8-K press release
- Should contain final unit count (41.4M if exercised)

---

## User's Hypothesis: CORRECT ‚úÖ

**You said:** "I think 8-K closing IPO press release will give you the final overallotment number"

**Testing shows:** The **CLOSING 8-K** (not pricing 8-K) should have final numbers, but:
1. Our scraper is currently finding the PRICING 8-K instead
2. Need to fix validation logic to distinguish pricing vs closing announcements

---

## Revised Data Collection Strategy

### Priority Order:

**Stage 1: Early Detection (424B4)**
- **Source:** 424B4 prospectus (Day 0)
- **Extract:** Base offering + overallotment option
- **Store as:** Preliminary shares (36M base, up to 41.4M max)
- **Benefit:** 1-3 days earlier than closing announcement

**Stage 2: Final Numbers (Closing 8-K)**
- **Source:** 8-K closing press release (Day +1 to +3)
- **Extract:** Final unit count after overallotment decision
- **Store as:** Final shares (41.4M if exercised, 36M if not)
- **Benefit:** Authoritative source within ~3 days

**Stage 3: Confirmation (10-Q)**
- **Source:** First 10-Q filing (Day +45 to +90)
- **Extract:** Shares outstanding from financial statements
- **Store as:** Verified final shares
- **Benefit:** Regulatory confirmation, definitive numbers

## Implementation Required

### Issue #1: Scraper Finding Wrong 8-K
**Current behavior:**
```python
# sec_data_scraper.py get_ipo_press_release()
# Currently finds: "Pricing of $360M IPO" (May 13)
# Should find: "Closing of $360M IPO" or "$414M IPO" (May 16)
```

**Fix needed:**
- Improve `_validate_ipo_press_release()` to distinguish pricing vs closing
- Pricing keywords: "pricing of", "priced at", "announced pricing"
- Closing keywords: "closed", "completed", "closing of", final proceeds amount

### Issue #2: Overallotment Tracking
**Database schema addition:**
```python
class SPAC(Base):
    # ... existing columns ...

    # Overallotment tracking
    shares_outstanding_base = Column(Float)          # From 424B4: 36M
    shares_outstanding_with_overallotment = Column(Float)  # From closing 8-K: 41.4M
    overallotment_exercised = Column(Boolean)        # True/False/None
    overallotment_finalized_date = Column(Date)      # When confirmed
```

### Issue #3: Filing Priority Logic
**Current flow (WRONG):**
```
1. Find 8-K press release (but gets pricing, not closing)
2. Extract from press release (gets base only)
3. Find 424B4 (secondary source)
```

**Correct flow:**
```
1. Find 424B4 (Day 0) ‚Üí Extract base + option
2. Find CLOSING 8-K (Day +1 to +3) ‚Üí Extract final shares
3. Verify with 10-Q (Day +45 to +90) ‚Üí Confirm
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Confirmed:** Closing 8-K should have final overallotment numbers (user was RIGHT)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem:** Scraper currently finds PRICING 8-K instead of CLOSING 8-K
3. üîß **Fix:** Update validation logic to distinguish pricing vs closing announcements
4. üìä **Database:** Add overallotment tracking fields
5. üîÑ **Flow:** Implement 424B4-first approach with closing 8-K for final numbers

---

## Validation Plan

Test with CCCX and other recent SPACs:
1. Manually find closing 8-K exhibit (May 16)
2. Check if it has 41.4M units or $414M
3. If YES ‚Üí User hypothesis confirmed
4. If NO ‚Üí Fall back to 10-Q for final confirmation

---

**Bottom Line:**
- You were RIGHT about closing 8-K having final numbers
- Our scraper just needs to find the RIGHT 8-K (closing, not pricing)
- 424B4 still valuable for 1-3 days earlier detection
- Use both: 424B4 for speed, closing 8-K for accuracy, 10-Q for confirmation
