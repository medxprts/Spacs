## For SPAC Monitoring: Do You Need Subscriptions?

### RSS Summaries Are Usually Enough

**For deal detection, RSS summaries (FREE) provide:**

‚úÖ **Headline:** "SPAC XYZ Announces Merger with TechCorp"
- Tells you: deal announced
- Ticker: XYZ
- Target: TechCorp

‚úÖ **First 1-2 paragraphs:**
- Deal value: $3 billion
- Deal type: "definitive agreement" (binding)
- Expected close: Q2 2026
- Key terms: "$10/share redemption"

‚úÖ **Enough for AI verification:**
```python
# AI can verify from summary alone:
verification = verify_deal_news_with_ai(ticker, {
    'title': 'SPAC XYZ Announces Merger with TechCorp',
    'description': 'XYZ reached definitive agreement to merge...'
})

# Result:
{
  'is_deal_announcement': True,
  'deal_stage': 'definitive_agreement',
  'target_name': 'TechCorp',
  'confidence': 95
}

# No subscription needed!
```

‚úÖ **Enough for Telegram alert:**
```

## Recommendation by Portfolio Size

### Managing <$50k: Free RSS Only

**Use:**
- Google News RSS (free)
- PR Newswire RSS (free)
- Seeking Alpha RSS (free)

**Why:**
- Headlines + summaries are enough for deal detection
- Can verify via SEC 8-K (free) for full details
- $40/month subscription not worth it for small portfolio

**Setup:**
```python
feeds = {
    'google_news': 'https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=SPAC+merger',
    'pr_newswire': 'https://www.prnewswire.com/rss/mergers-and-acquisitions.rss',
    'seeking_alpha': 'https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/spacs.xml'
}
```

### Managing $50k-$200k: Add WSJ ($40/month)

**Use:**
- All free feeds (above)
- + WSJ RSS feeds

**Why:**
- WSJ breaks deals 15-30 min faster than free sources
- Tier 1 credibility (AI confidence bonus)
- Full articles useful for bigger positions
- ROI: Catching ONE deal 30 min early = easily worth $40

**Setup:**
```python
feeds = {
    # Free
    'google_news': '...',
    'pr_newswire': '...',
    'seeking_alpha': '...',

    # WSJ (Tier 1)
    'wsj_markets': 'https://feeds.a.dj.com/rss/RSSMarketsMain.xml',
    'wsj_deals': 'https://feeds.a.dj.com/rss/RSSWSJD.xml'
}
```

**Use:**
- All free feeds
- + WSJ ($40/month)
- + NYT ($25/month)
- + FT ($75/month)
- + Barron's ($30/month)

**Why:**

```python
feeds = {
    # Free
    'google_news': '...',

## What About Paywalled Content?

### Some RSS Feeds Show Full Text (Rare)

**Sources that sometimes include full text in RSS:**
- Seeking Alpha (free tier articles)
- Some business wire releases
- Company press releases (always free)

**Sources that only show summaries in RSS:**
- WSJ (1-2 paragraphs max)
- NYT (1-2 paragraphs max)
- FT (1 paragraph max)
- Barron's (summary only)

### How to Tell if RSS Has Full Text

Check the RSS entry:
```xml
<!-- Summary only (subscription needed for full) -->
<description>
  First paragraph here... [Read more at WSJ.com - subscription required]
</description>

<!-- Full text included (rare) -->
<content:encoded>
  <![CDATA[
    Full article text here... [entire article]
  ]]>
</content:encoded>
```

Most premium sources (WSJ, NYT, FT) only include summaries in RSS.
