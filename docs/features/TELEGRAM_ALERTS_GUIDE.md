## What Triggers an Alert?

**Leak Detection Criteria:**
1. SPAC status = SEARCHING (no deal announced)
2. AND one of:
   - 3+ Reddit comments mention deal speculation
   - Same target company mentioned 2+ times

**Confidence Calculation:**
- Each speculation comment: +20% confidence
- Each target mention: +30% confidence
- Max confidence: 95%

**Alert Threshold:**
- Telegram alerts sent only for confidence â‰¥ 70%
- Lower confidence leaks logged but not alerted

## What To Do When You Get an Alert

1. **Review Premium**: High premium + leak = market may already know
2. **Check Reddit**: Click through to r/SPACs Daily Discussion
3. **Read Comments**: Review the actual speculation (URLs in log files)
4. **Verify Target**: Search for the rumored target company
5. **Monitor Price Action**: Watch for volume/price spikes
6. **Set Price Alerts**: Consider entry point if conviction high

## Adjusting Alert Sensitivity

To change the confidence threshold for alerts, edit:
`/home/ubuntu/spac-research/reddit_sentiment_tracker.py`

Find line ~533:
```python
if leak_report['confidence'] >= 70:  # Change this number
```

- **Lower (e.g., 50)**: More alerts, more false positives
- **Higher (e.g., 80)**: Fewer alerts, higher quality signals
- **Default: 70%** - Good balance

## Disable Telegram Alerts

Remove from `.env`:
```bash
# Comment out or remove these lines:
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
# TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...
```

Alerts will stop, but log files continue.
