# Warrant Extraction Fixes - October 8, 2025

## Critical Issues Identified from Test Results

### Test Results Summary (Before Fixes)
- **Overall capture rate:** 66.7% (80/120 data points)
- **Warrant fields:** 20-40% capture (CRITICAL FAILURE)
  - warrant_redemption_price: 20% (1/5)
  - warrant_redemption_days: 20% (1/5)
  - warrant_expiration_years: 40% (2/5)
- **Management:** 80% ✅
- **Sponsor economics:** 80% ✅
- **Overallotment:** 80% ✅

### Root Causes Discovered

#### Issue #1: Hallucination for Rights-Only SPACs
**Problem:** CHPG has "1 share + 1 right" (NO warrants) but database showed:
- warrant_redemption_price = 18.0 (HALLUCINATED)
- warrant_redemption_days = 30 (HALLUCINATED)

**Root cause:** Pre-check logic was checking cover page text for "warrant" keyword, which many 424B4s mention when describing market conditions or other SPACs. The check was:
```python
if 'warrant' in cover_page.lower():
    has_warrants = True  # FALSE POSITIVE if document mentions warrants in general
```

**Fix Applied:** Query database for actual `unit_structure` field (already extracted earlier in enrichment):
```python
# sec_data_scraper.py lines 2067-2095
if ticker:
    try:
        from database import SessionLocal, SPAC
        db = SessionLocal()
        spac_record = db.query(SPAC).filter(SPAC.ticker == ticker).first()
        if spac_record and spac_record.unit_structure:
            unit_structure_check = spac_record.unit_structure.lower()
            if 'right' in unit_structure_check and 'warrant' not in unit_structure_check:
                has_warrants = False
                print(f"   ℹ️  SPAC has rights only (unit: {spac_record.unit_structure}) - skipping warrant extraction")
            elif 'warrant' in unit_structure_check:
                has_warrants = True
                print(f"   ✓ SPAC has warrants (unit: {spac_record.unit_structure})")
```

**Expected impact:** Prevents AI from being called for rights-only SPACs, eliminating hallucination entirely.

#### Issue #2: Missing Warrant Redemption Terms for CCCX
**Problem:** CCCX has "1 share + 1/4 warrant" but missing:
- warrant_redemption_price: None (expected $18.00)
- warrant_redemption_days: None (expected "20 trading days within 30-day period")

**Evidence from previous session:**
- Warrant redemption terms found at position 114,934 in CCCX 424B4
- Text: "if, and only if, the last sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share... for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period"
- This is within the SUMMARY section, under "The Offering" subsection

**Root cause:** The `extract_description_of_securities_section()` method was searching for "SUMMARY" as a fallback pattern, which matched the first occurrence at the beginning of the document (Prospectus Summary), not the actual Description of Securities section.

**Fix Applied:** Remove "SUMMARY" pattern from Description of Securities extraction:
```python
# sec_data_scraper.py lines 2830-2875
patterns = [
    r"\n\s*DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES\s*\n",
    r"\n\s*Description of Securities\s*\n",
    r"\n\s*DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\s*\n",
    r"\n\s*Description of Capital Stock\s*\n",
    # REMOVED: r"\bSUMMARY\b"  # Too broad, matches wrong section
]
```

**Expected impact:**
- For SPACs with separate "Description of Securities" section: Correctly extracts that section
- For SPACs like CCCX: Won't extract incorrect section, will rely on expanded SUMMARY/Offering section (150K chars) which already contains warrant terms
- The warrant extraction AI receives cover_page + offering_section (now 150K chars) + description_of_securities

---

## Technical Details

### Warrant Extraction Input Sources (After Fixes)
1. **Cover page** (~15K chars): Unit structure, basic warrant info
2. **Offering section** (150K chars): Complete SUMMARY section including all "The Offering" subsections
3. **Description of Securities** (100K chars): Detailed warrant terms (if section exists)

**Total input to AI:** Up to 265K chars for warrant extraction

### AI Prompt Strategy
The warrant extraction prompt explicitly instructs the AI to:
- NOT guess or assume standard values
- Return null if explicit language not found
- Search for specific phrases like "equals or exceeds $18.00" and "20 trading days within a 30-trading day period"
- Only extract if SPAC has actual warrants (not just rights)

---

## Expected Test Results After Fixes

### Rights-Only SPACs (CHPG, MLAC, RANG)
**Before:** Showing hallucinated warrant data (e.g., CHPG had redemption_price=18.0)
**After:** All warrant fields should be NULL/None (extraction skipped entirely)

**Validation:**
```sql
SELECT ticker, unit_structure, warrant_redemption_price, warrant_redemption_days
FROM spacs
WHERE ticker IN ('CHPG', 'MLAC', 'RANG');
```
Expected: All warrant fields = NULL

### Warrant-Holding SPACs (CCCX)
**Before:** warrant_redemption_price=None, warrant_redemption_days=None
**After:** warrant_redemption_price=18.0, warrant_redemption_days="20 trading days within 30-day period"

**Validation:**
```sql
SELECT ticker, unit_structure, warrant_redemption_price, warrant_redemption_days
FROM spacs
WHERE ticker = 'CCCX';
```
Expected: redemption_price=18.0, redemption_days contains "20" and "30"

## Capture Rate Projections

### Before Fixes
- Warrant fields: 20-40% (due to hallucination and missing data)
- Overall: 66.7%

### After Fixes
- Warrant fields for warrant-holding SPACs: **90-100%** (AI has full 265K char context)
- Warrant fields for rights-only SPACs: **100% NULL** (extraction skipped)
- Overall: **85%+**

### Breakdown by Field Category
| Category | Before | After (Projected) |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Overallotment | 80% | 80% |
| Extensions | 60% | 70% |
| **Warrants** | **25%** | **95%** |
| Management | 80% | 80% |
| Sponsor Economics | 80% | 80% |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Fix #1 Applied:** Database-based warrant/rights detection
2. ✅ **Fix #2 Applied:** Removed "SUMMARY" from Description of Securities patterns
3. ⏳ **Testing:** Running test_single_spac_cccx.py to validate CCCX extraction
4. ⏳ **Testing:** Waiting for test_424b4_on_5_new_spacs.py to complete (5 additional SPACs)
5. ⬜ **Re-test original 5 SPACs:** Run test_424b4_on_5_spacs.py again to validate fixes
6. ⬜ **Target validation:** Confirm overall capture rate reaches 85%+
7. ⬜ **Deploy:** If target met, deploy to all 186 SPACs
