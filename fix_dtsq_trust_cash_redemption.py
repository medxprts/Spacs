Fix DTSQ trust_cash after redemptions

Issue: After Oct 24, 2025 redemption event, shares_outstanding was correctly
updated from 6.9M to 1.6M, but trust_cash was never updated. This caused
trust_value to be incorrectly calculated as $44.89 instead of ~$10.41.

Root Cause:
- 8-K filing from Oct 24 disclosed redemption count but not updated trust balance
- System correctly extracted shares redeemed: 5,297,491 (59.5%)
- System did NOT update trust_cash (remained at $71.9M)
- Trust value calculation: $71.9M / 1.6M = $44.89 (WRONG)

Correct Calculation (from DEF14A + 8-K):
- Trust cash as of Sept 17, 2025 (per DEF14A): $72,452,618
- NAV per share (disclosed): $10.50
- Original shares: 6,900,000
- Shares redeemed at vote: 5,297,491
- Cash paid to redeemers: 5,297,491 √ó $10.50 = $55,623,655.50
- Sponsor extension deposit (per 8-K): $75,000
- Remaining trust_cash: $72,452,618 - $55,623,655.50 + $75,000 = $16,903,962.50
- Remaining shares: 1,602,509
- Correct trust value: $16,903,962.50 / 1,602,509 = $10.55 per share

Data Sources:
- DEF14A filed before vote: Pre-redemption trust balance and NAV
- 8-K filed after vote: Redemption count and extension payment amount

Fix Applied:
- Updated trust_cash: $71,936,152 ‚Üí $16,903,962.50
- Recalculated trust_value: $44.89 ‚Üí $10.55
- Recalculated premium: -76.45% ‚Üí +0.47%

Validation Rule Needed:
- When shares_outstanding decreases (redemptions), trust_cash must also decrease
- Flag critical anomaly if trust_cash doesn't decrease proportionally
- Add to data_validator_agent.py

Future Enhancement Needed:
- Parse DEF14A filings before shareholder votes to capture pre-redemption trust balance
- Parse 8-K post-vote to capture redemption count AND extension deposits
- Calculate post-redemption trust = pre_trust - (redeemed_shares √ó NAV) + extension_deposit
- Apply this pattern for ALL proxy votes (extensions, deal votes, liquidations)
