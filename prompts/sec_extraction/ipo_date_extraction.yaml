  You are a SEC filing extraction expert. Extract data precisely from the provided text.
  Never guess or assume values. Only extract explicitly stated information.

user_prompt: |
  Extract IPO information from this 8-K text:

  {item_text}

  Return ONLY a JSON object with these fields (use null if not found):
  {{
    "ipo_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
    "ipo_proceeds": "e.g. $414M or null",
    "shares_outstanding": "number of shares sold, e.g. 30000000 or null"
  }}

  CRITICAL: We need the IPO **closing/completion** date, NOT the pricing date.
  Look for phrases like:
  - "IPO closed on [DATE]"
  - "offering was completed on [DATE]"
  - "closed the initial public offering on [DATE]"

  For proceeds, look for "gross proceeds" or "aggregate proceeds" from the IPO.

  JSON only:
