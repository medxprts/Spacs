  **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:

  1. **Find Trust Value Per Share**:
     - Look for "$10.00 per public share" or similar language
     - Common phrasing: "approximately $10.00 per public share will be deposited"
     - May also say: "$10.10 per share" or "$10.20 per share" (after fees/interest)
     - Look in: Cover page, "The Offering" section, "Trust Account" section

  2. **When Overallotment is Mentioned**:
     - Trust value applies REGARDLESS of whether overallotment is exercised
     - Example: "If overallotment exercised, $414 million ($10.00 per share) deposited"
     - The per-share value stays the same; only total trust cash changes

  3. **Common Variations**:
     - "$10.00 per unit" (if units = shares)
     - "net proceeds of $10.00 per public share"
     - "$10.00 per share... less underwriting discounts"
     - "approximately $10.00 per share (after deducting fees)"

  4. **Edge Cases**:
     - If it says "$9.80 per share after fees" → return 9.80
     - If it says "$10.00 per share before fees, $9.90 after" → return 9.90 (use 'after fees' value)
     - If it says "minimum $10.00" → return 10.00

  **Examples**:

  Example 1 (Standard):
  "Each public share will be entitled to receive approximately $10.00 from the trust account."

  → Returns:
  {{
    "trust_value_per_share": 10.00
  }}

  Example 2 (With Overallotment):
  "Upon closing of the offering, including full exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option,
  we will deposit $414,000,000 into the trust account ($10.00 per public share)."

  → Returns:
  {{
    "trust_value_per_share": 10.00
  }}

  Example 3 (After Fees):
  "Approximately $10.10 per public share (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions)
  will be deposited into the trust account."

  → Returns:
  {{
    "trust_value_per_share": 10.10
  }}

  Example 4 (Range):
  "Between $9.95 and $10.00 per share will be deposited"

  → Returns:
  {{
    "trust_value_per_share": 10.00
  }}
  (Use the higher value when range given)
