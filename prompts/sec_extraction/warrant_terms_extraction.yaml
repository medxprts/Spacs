user_prompt: |
  Extract warrant terms from this SPAC S-1 filing section.

  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Warrant ratio: How many warrants per share? Common values: 0.25 (1/4), 0.333 (1/3), 0.5 (1/2), 1.0 (whole)
  2. Exercise price: Typically $11.50 (range $10-$15)
  3. Expiration: Typically 5 years (range 3-7 years)

  Look for phrases like:
  - "Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant" → ratio = 0.333
  - "Warrants are exercisable at $11.50 per share" → exercise_price = 11.50
  - "Warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination" → expiration = 5

  Return ONLY valid JSON:
  {{
    "warrant_ratio": float or null (e.g., 0.333 for "one-third"),
    "exercise_price": float or null (e.g., 11.50),
    "warrant_expiration_years": int or null (e.g., 5)
  }}

  Filing text:
  {warrant_text}
